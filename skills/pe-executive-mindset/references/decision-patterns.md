# Decision Patterns

How the PE ownership context shapes the way portfolio company executives make decisions.

## The Exit Clock

The finite hold period is the defining feature of PE executive decision-making.

- Historical hold: 3-5 years. Current median: ~5.8 years (McKinsey reports 6.7 years in 2024)
- Exit planning begins from day one of ownership
- In the final 12-24 months before exit:
  - Financial presentation is polished
  - EBITDA is maximized
  - A growth narrative is developed for the next buyer
  - The company is "dressed up" for sale
  - CapEx that won't produce visible returns before sale is deferred
  - L&D programs unconnected to immediate performance get cut
- Some PE firms deliberately leave "room for growth for the next owner"

### What Gets Prioritized Under the Exit Clock

- Rapid restructuring and cost rationalization
- Bolt-on acquisitions that build scale
- Operational improvements with fast ROI
- Pricing optimization (can deliver 300-700 bps margin expansion)
- Any initiative with measurable, attributable EBITDA impact

### What Gets Deprioritized

- Long-term R&D without near-term payoff
- Infrastructure modernization with multi-year timelines
- Cultural investment and employee development programs
- Technology buildouts that won't show returns within the hold period
- Anything that requires more than 18-24 months to demonstrate value

### Time-Value Math

AlixPartners calculates that value creation initiatives started in month 1 of a 5-year hold have 60 months to compound. Started in month 12, only 48 months — a 20% reduction in runway that typically means 30%+ less impact. This math drives relentless urgency from day one.

## Leverage Effects on Decision-Making

Leverage is not just capital structure — it changes the cognitive landscape.

- Typical LBO: 20-40% equity, 60-80% debt (4-7x EBITDA)
- A 10% increase in company value produces a 50% return on equity at 5:1 leverage — the amplification effect
- But debt service consumes cash, making liquidity, covenant compliance, and refinancing windows constantly salient
- Executives reason in constraint sets: "What improves EBITDA/cash flow while staying inside covenant and refinancing tolerances?"

### When Leverage Works

- Forces discipline on cash flow and efficiency
- Eliminates wasteful spending
- Concentrates management attention on high-impact initiatives

### When Leverage Becomes Destructive

- Prevents reinvestment needed for competitiveness
- Makes the company fragile to demand shocks
- Interest payments consume operating income (in extreme cases, 97% of operating income)
- 20% of PE takeovers end in bankruptcy — 10x the rate for non-PE firms

### Dividend Recapitalizations

A specific lever that illustrates PE incentive tensions:

- Typical recap increases total debt by ~84%
- Increases bankruptcy likelihood substantially
- Accelerates cash returns to investors (boosting IRR via earlier cash flows)
- Creates "optics vs. resilience" tension for executives
- Even when CEOs are not direct beneficiaries, they manage inside the consequences: refinancing pressure, tighter cost controls, wage constraints

## Buy-and-Build

The dominant PE playbook:

- 70%+ of PE deals include add-on acquisitions
- Economic logic: multiple arbitrage. A $10M EBITDA company sells at 5x. Combine several into a $50M EBITDA entity and it commands 8-10x — value created through scale, not operations.
- For executives, this means running continuous integration while operating the base business
- For employees of acquired companies: process standardization, role consolidation, cultural subordination to the platform, leadership turnover
- Research indicates 70% of M&A transactions fail to achieve expected value, with culture clash as a primary factor

## Growth vs. Extraction

The industry narrative is shifting:

- Revenue growth now accounts for ~54% of total value creation (up from much less in earlier eras)
- Margin improvement contributes only ~14%
- "Rationalizing costs is no longer a differentiator" — the search firms
- Investment professionals view results orientation and urgency as the most important competencies, more than strategic vision
- But cost cuts still provide the "quick wins" that fund growth initiatives
- Typical sequencing: immediate cost rationalization, then efficiency improvements, then revenue growth

## Sponsor Signaling

Executives interpret sponsor behavior as a signaling system:

- What the board asks about weekly is what actually matters
- When the sponsor's "ask" shifts from efficiency to integration and growth (e.g., roll-ups, go-to-market), executives adapt by building scaling capabilities
- Operating partners' focus areas reveal the sponsor's real priorities
- Change in reporting requests or KPI emphasis signals thesis evolution

## MIP Resets and Incentive Renegotiation

- Incentives often renegotiated mid-hold when performance diverges from plan or timeline changes
- An early investor cash-out can destroy the value of management equity — creating demand for reset mechanisms
- Incentives tied too tightly to the original thesis can "freeze" leadership, making them unwilling to adapt
- In extended holds, executives shift from "single exit sprint" to "multi-act ownership" thinking, updating their personal calculus around: probability of replacement, whether equity remains in the money, and whether incentives will be reset

## IRR vs. Cash-on-Cash Multiple

A subtle but important distinction in PE executive thinking:

- IRR (Internal Rate of Return) is time-weighted — earlier cash flows produce higher IRR even if total returns are the same
- MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) is absolute — measures total cash returned vs. cash invested
- Some actions boost IRR without improving MOIC (e.g., dividend recaps that bring cash forward)
- Executives under IRR-focused sponsors may face pressure for actions that accelerate distributions vs. actions that maximize total value

## Deal-Type Variation

PE executive thinking varies significantly by deal type. A generic model is insufficient.

### Buyout

- Higher leverage, covenant/refinancing sensitivity; exit is central
- Larger equity upside with strong leaver clauses; meaningful co-invest/rollover
- Performance metrics: EBITDA/cash flow, MOIC/IRR thresholds; ratchets common
- Governance: High replacement probability; tight board cadence; speed and measurability rewarded

### Growth

- Often lower leverage than classic buyout; more reinvestment for scaling
- Equity upside still central; options common; performance hurdles frequent
- Performance metrics: Revenue/ARR growth and cash efficiency tracked operationally; equity awards still investment-return oriented
- Governance: Talent-building and integration (platform expansion) emphasized; leadership capability viewed as key lever

### Distressed / Turnaround

- Liquidity constraints; restructuring milestones; high job risk
- Higher cash/retention component; equity upside more uncertain; frequent resets
- Performance metrics: Liquidity, covenant compliance, restructuring milestones; exit value contingent
- Governance: "Survival-first" approach; board may replace quickly if turnaround stalls; incentives often re-cut as facts change

### Carve-Outs

- A growing share of PE deal flow — buying a division from a larger company
- Unique challenge: must establish stand-alone corporate functions (IT, HR, Finance) that previously ran through the parent
- Transition Services Agreements (TSAs) define the bridge period; exiting TSAs on time is a critical 100-day priority
- Often start without independent ERP systems, financial reporting infrastructure, or procurement contracts
- The executive mindset is "build the plane while flying it" rather than "optimize the existing plane"
- For employees, carve-outs are among the most disorienting experiences — loss of parent company identity, systems, and support structures

## Motivation Dynamics Across the Deal Lifecycle

KPMG survey data reveals that management motivation is not constant — it spikes and dips predictably:

- **Immediately post-deal**: Motivation spikes as ownership salience is highest — executives have just received equity and can see the direct connection between their actions and personal wealth
- **Mid-hold (~1-2 years)**: Motivation can plateau or dip, especially if early initiatives have been executed and the next phase feels less urgent
- **~3 years / exit anticipation**: Motivation spikes again as the anticipated exit approaches and equity crystallization becomes tangible
- **Early investor cash-out**: If the PE firm exits earlier than expected (e.g., secondary sale), management may view their sweet equity as losing value due to insufficient time for appreciation — this can severely damage motivation and trigger renegotiations
- **Extended holds (5+ years)**: MIP resets become more likely; executives shift from sprint to marathon thinking and may disengage if equity is no longer clearly "in the money"

This lifecycle pattern matters for initiative timing: launching major transformation during motivational dips requires different leadership approaches than launching during spikes.
