# Governance and Monitoring

How PE portfolio companies are governed and why the oversight intensity shapes executive behavior.

## Board Composition

- Small boards: 5-7 members (vs. 10-12 at public companies)
- PE firm holds 2-3 seats directly
- Management gets 1-2 seats (CEO, sometimes CFO)
- 1-3 independent directors chosen for specific expertise aligned with the value creation plan
- 88% of PE-backed CEOs sit on their company's board; 20% serve as chair
- Unlike public boards (80%+ independent), PE boards exist to serve the investor's interests directly

## Board Authority vs CEO Autonomy

Decisions requiring board approval:

- Capital expenditures above $500K-$5M (threshold varies by company size)
- All M&A activity
- C-suite hiring and firing
- Annual budgets
- Debt refinancing
- Major customer contracts
- Any changes to the value creation plan

CEO operational autonomy (day-to-day):

- Hiring below C-suite
- Tactical pricing decisions
- Vendor selection
- Operational execution within the approved plan

The boundary: executives have latitude on execution but not on direction. Strategy is co-owned with the sponsor.

## Reporting Cadence

### Weekly Flash Reports

- Top-line revenue
- Bookings/pipeline
- Cash position
- Key operational metrics

### Monthly Financial Packages

- Full P&L, balance sheet, cash flow statements
- Budget-versus-actual variance analysis
- EBITDA bridges (explaining changes from prior period)
- KPI dashboards
- Accompanied by a one-hour review meeting with PE owners
- Books expected to close in ~10 days (vs. 20+ at non-PE companies)

### Quarterly Business Reviews

- Full leadership team presents
- Strategic initiative progress
- Value creation plan scorecard
- Pipeline and market updates
- Forward-looking projections

## The Value Creation Plan (VCP)

The CEO's operating constitution for the entire hold period. Created within the first 100 days.

### Structure

- Every major initiative specified with:
  - Expected EBITDA impact
  - Required investment
  - Timeline
  - Accountable owner
  - Key milestones

### Typical VCP Categories

- **Leadership and talent**: Right people in right seats; management assessment and changes
- **Quick wins** (months 1-6): Pricing adjustments, procurement savings, working capital optimization
- **Medium-term operational improvements** (months 3-18): Supplier renegotiations, org restructuring, salesforce integration
- **Longer-term transformation** (months 6-36): Technology modernization, new markets, offshoring/nearshoring
- **Add-on acquisition pipeline**: Targets, integration playbooks, synergy cases

### The 100-Day Plan Within the VCP

- Days 1-30: Data infrastructure, management alignment, baseline KPIs
- Days 31-60: Deep functional assessments, deal thesis validation
- Days 61-100: Launch major initiatives, deliver quick wins
- Operating partners on-site 2-3 days/week during this period
- 90% of PE firms formally plan the first 100 days

### Deviation Protocol

Deviation from the VCP requires board approval. Executives are measured against it continuously. This is why PE executives are reluctant to pursue initiatives not in the plan — even good ideas need to survive the governance filter.

## KPI Cascades

### Primary (Board-Level)

- EBITDA and EBITDA margin
- Revenue growth (organic vs. acquired)
- Free cash flow conversion
- Debt/EBITDA leverage ratio
- MOIC and IRR progress

### Secondary (Operating-Level)

- Working capital metrics: DSO, DPO, inventory turns
- Sales productivity: revenue per rep, pipeline conversion, CAC, LTV
- Customer metrics: churn, NRR, NPS
- Operational efficiency: cost per unit, utilization, throughput
- For SaaS: Rule of 40 (revenue growth % + EBITDA margin % > 40)

### Benchmarks

- Top-quartile PE firms achieve 15-20% annual EBITDA growth
- Revenue growth accounts for ~54% of total value creation in recent data
- Margin improvement contributes ~14%
- Multiple expansion and leverage/financial engineering account for the rest

## Operating Partner Model

PE firms deploy operating partners — experienced executives who work alongside management:

- On-site 2-3 days/week in the first 100 days
- Ongoing advisory and functional support
- Bridge between sponsor expectations and management execution
- Increasingly organized into functional expert teams (sales, technology, procurement, talent)
- Some firms have built dedicated operating groups of 20-50+ professionals

## Consequences of Missing Targets

Predictable escalation:

1. Increased monitoring intensity — more frequent calls, operating partner involvement ratchets up
2. PE firm shifts from advisory to directive mode, inserting itself into operational decisions
3. Third-party consultants arrive to diagnose problems
4. CFO is typically changed first (CFO tenure averages 2.5 years vs. 5.6 at public companies)
5. CEO replaced if trajectory doesn't improve (extends hold by 6-12 months)
