# Psychological Experience

The emotional and moral reality of being a PE portfolio company executive who must make decisions that harm people. This is not about excusing harmful decisions — it's about understanding the human experience inside the system.

## Clinical Coping Patterns

Research by Kets de Vries and Balazs (INSEAD, 1997) identified five coping patterns among executives who implement layoffs ("executioners"):

- **Compulsive/ritualistic**: Treat layoffs as mechanical duty, lean heavily on process and procedure to avoid emotional engagement
- **Abrasive**: Become hostile and aggressive as a defense mechanism
- **Dissociative**: Emotionally detach entirely from the situation
- **Alexithymic**: Lose the ability to identify or express emotions — a clinical numbness
- **Depressive**: Experience guilt, sorrow, sleeplessness, and clinical depression symptoms

Managers do not occupy a permanent position. A 2024 study found they shift constantly between rationalistic, loyal, empathic, and critical stances — the experience is chronically oscillating between rationalization and distress.

## Moral Injury

Moral injury (originally defined studying Vietnam veterans) has been applied to corporate contexts. It is defined as "a trauma response to witnessing or participating in workplace behaviors that contradict one's moral beliefs in high-stakes situations."

Critical distinction: moral injury is not burnout. It is an ethical wound affecting identity, trust, and meaning. It strikes hardest in people who care deeply about their work, not those who are indifferent.

## Moral Disengagement

Bandura's eight mechanisms explain how executives psychologically survive:

- **Moral justification**: "We had to cut to save the company"
- **Euphemistic labeling**: "Rightsizing" instead of mass firing, "optimizing the cost structure" instead of cutting jobs
- **Advantageous comparison**: "At least we're offering severance, unlike Company X"
- **Displacement of responsibility**: "The PE firm set the targets"
- **Diffusion of responsibility**: "The board made this decision collectively"
- **Distortion of consequences**: Focusing on percentages rather than individual people
- **Dehumanization**: Employees become "headcount," "FTEs," or "resources"
- **Attribution of blame**: "Performance wasn't where it needed to be"

Research suggests executives who morally disengage more readily may be systematically rewarded and promoted — a self-reinforcing selection effect.

## Dirty Work and Identity Threat

Conducting layoffs constitutes morally stigmatized "dirty work." Executives defend their identity through:

- **Reframing**: Casting layoffs as "necessary business decisions"
- **Recalibrating**: Adjusting moral standards to the PE context
- **Refocusing**: Emphasizing positive aspects of their role (company building, growth)
- **Selective comparison**: Comparing favorably to more callous competitors

Moral dirty work constitutes a graver identity threat than physical or social dirty work, driving stronger reliance on in-group members (other PE executives, operating partners) as social buffers.

## The "Necessary Evils" Emotional Cocktail

Margolis (Harvard) and Molinsky (Brandeis) documented the characteristic emotional mix: sympathy, sadness, guilt, shame, anxiety, and sometimes anger — experienced simultaneously.

The core challenge is doing "two seemingly contradictory things at once: be compassionate and be direct." Companies often structure layoff processes to minimize emotional expression ("keep discussions to the minimum"), which protects the organization but deepens the executor's moral isolation.

## Ethical Fading

Tenbrunsel and Bazerman's concept: the process by which ethical dimensions disappear from executive decision frames. Four enablers:

- **Language euphemisms**: "Optimizing the cost structure" removes the ethical dimension
- **Slippery slope**: Each small cut normalizes the next, slightly larger one
- **Errors in perceptual causation**: Attributing outcomes to market forces rather than decisions
- **Self-image constraints**: "I'm a good person, therefore this must be the right thing"

Related concept — "ethical blindness": a temporary, unconscious state where ethical dimensions seem nonexistent. Triggers include ambitiously stretched goals, narrow/highly incentivized structures, and ambiguous rules — all hallmarks of PE portfolio management.

## Normalization of Deviance

Diane Vaughan's concept (from the Challenger disaster): the gradual process by which unacceptable practices become acceptable through repetition without immediate catastrophe. Vaughan explicitly repudiates villain narratives — managers were conformists whose organizational culture gradually redefined dangerous deviations as normal.

Applied to PE: each round of cost-cutting that doesn't produce immediate disaster becomes the new baseline, enabling progressively deeper cuts. The first 5% headcount reduction seems reasonable; then 10%; then facility closure. Each step is small. The cumulative effect is devastating.

## Structural Explanations

Robert Jackall's ethnographic research (Moral Mazes, 1988): "What is right in the corporation is what the guy above you wants from you. That's what morality is in the corporation." He describes "a finely honed odyssey of moral transformation, in which the actors themselves remain largely unaware of the nature of their journey."

Zygmunt Bauman identified three mechanisms of bureaucratic harm that map precisely onto PE operations:

- **Authority**: The PE board directs
- **Routinization**: Quarterly targets routinize decisions
- **Dehumanization**: Employees become "headcount"

His most relevant insight: "Cruelty correlates with certain patterns of social interaction much more closely than it does with personality features."

## The Toll on Middle Managers and HR

The burden falls heaviest on those who implement without having decided:

- HR professionals report higher burnout (54% vs. 48%), depression (54% vs. 44%), and anxiety (51% vs. 42%)
- 46% of HR professionals reported witnessing things at work that go against their values (vs. 29% non-HR)
- 46% admitted doing things misaligned with their own morals (vs. 18% non-HR)
- Middle managers comprised 30% of all layoffs in 2023 (up from 20% in 2018) — the people delivering layoff news are among the most likely to receive it
- "Layoff survivor sickness" affects those who remain, not just those who leave

## First-Person Accounts

- **Ben Horowitz** (The Hard Thing About Hard Things): Described lying awake at 3 a.m. making cuts that affected friends. "The hard thing isn't setting a big, hairy, audacious goal. The hard thing is laying people off when you miss the big goal."
- **Brian Chesky** (Airbnb): His 2020 layoff letter used the word "love" — later regretted — exposing the genuine confusion between institutional obligation and personal attachment
- **Kenneth Freeman** (Quest Diagnostics chair / KKR partner): After 40+ years, concluded "the tough guy approach makes no sense" — advocated treating employees with consideration during closures
- **55% of CEOs** experienced mental health challenges in 2024 (24-point jump from prior years); nearly half report loneliness that intensifies these challenges

## Cognitive Dissonance

The gap between self-image and actions creates classic cognitive dissonance:

- "I develop people" vs. "I am terminating them"
- "I build companies" vs. "I am hollowing out capabilities for a near-term exit"
- "I care about my team" vs. "I am replacing 30-40% of my direct reports"

Executives resolve this dissonance through the moral disengagement mechanisms above, through reframing (casting themselves as "making the hard calls"), or through compartmentalization. The dissonance is not resolved permanently — it resurfaces with each new round of cuts.

## Emotional Labor

Arlie Hochschild's framework, originally applied to service workers, maps directly onto PE executive life:

- CEOs must project confidence, decisiveness, and calm while experiencing guilt, anxiety, and uncertainty
- Ben Horowitz's account of "The Struggle" — walking into the office pretending to be calm when you are not — directly illustrates emotional labor at the CEO level
- The performative demands intensify during layoffs: executives must be "compassionate but firm," deliver bad news without showing too much emotion, and then immediately return to managing the business
- Brian Chesky's use of the word "love" in his Airbnb layoff letter — later regretted — exposed the fault line between authentic emotion and institutional role

## Sensemaking

Karl Weick's and Julia Balogun's work on how managers construct meaning from morally ambiguous situations:

- Executives in restructurings actively construct narratives that make their actions coherent and justified
- These narratives are not purely cynical — they are how people maintain agency and purpose under conditions of moral ambiguity
- Sensemaking is social: executives construct meaning through conversations with peers, operating partners, and board members who share their framework
- When the shared narrative breaks down (e.g., the company fails despite "doing everything right"), the psychological consequences can be severe

## Administrative Evil

Guy Adams and Danny Balfour's concept: "ordinary people within their normal professional and administrative roles can engage in acts of evil without being aware that they are doing anything wrong."

The PE fund structure creates a pressure cascade that illustrates this:

- 10-year fund life creates time pressure at the GP level
- 20-25% annual return targets create performance pressure
- Carried interest incentives concentrate GP wealth in fund returns
- This cascades to portfolio companies through equity structures, KPI targets, and governance intensity
- At each level, participants are acting within their professional roles, following established procedures, and pursuing legitimate institutional goals — yet the cumulative effect on workers and communities can be devastating

## Practical Resources and Counter-Evidence

Evidence that challenges default PE assumptions about restructuring:

- Wayne Cascio's *Responsible Restructuring* (2002), based on 18 years of S&P 500 data, found that companies restructuring through downsizing are often not more profitable than those that don't — giving executives a genuine evidence base for alternatives
- Margolis and Molinsky's research offers specific implementation guidance: have pairs or teams perform layoff tasks together rather than alone; create ample time and space afterward for decompression; provide private environments; recognize that organizations should focus on the well-being of those who perform layoffs, not only those who receive them
- Hougaard and Carter's "Wise Compassion Flywheel" framework (based on data from thousands of leaders across nearly 100 countries) addresses how to balance compassion with the decisiveness required for hard decisions

## The Core Insight

Every major scholar in this tradition maintains empathy for individuals within harmful systems. The PE portfolio company executive is best understood not as a villain or victim but as a person recruited into a system that manufactures moral compromise through authority, incentives, language, and routine — then provides just enough psychological armor to keep going.

The system, not the individual, is the primary subject.
