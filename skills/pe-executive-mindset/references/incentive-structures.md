# Incentive Structures

Detailed breakdown of how PE portfolio company executive compensation works and why it shapes every decision.

## Cash Compensation

- Average U.S. base salary: $524K (ranges from $372K at <$50M revenue to $828K at >$1B revenue)
- Average cash bonus: 69% of base salary (~$386K)
- Total average cash: ~$910K
- Cash is deliberately below public-company equivalents (S&P 500 average base: ~$800K) to force wealth creation through equity
- Base and bonus can increase post-buyout (one study found ~25% increase) as compensation for higher job risk and more performance-sensitive contracts
- Cash serves as a liquidity bridge through the illiquid holding period and partial insurance against the ~73% replacement probability

## Management Equity Program (MEP/MIP)

The primary wealth engine:

- PE firms carve out 5-20% of total company equity for management (median pool: ~10% of shares outstanding undiluted)
- CEO personally receives median ~2.6% of fully diluted equity
- Average projected CEO exit value: $11.2M (up to $16.1M at companies >$1B revenue)
- ~63% of pool allocated at or near transaction; remainder reserved for later hires, replacements, and resets

### Instrument Types

- Stock options: Most common (61% of plans)
- Profits interests: Second most common (44%), favorable tax treatment in LLC/partnership structures
- Full-value awards (RSUs): Far less common (11%)
- Sweet equity (common in European deals): Shares bought at discounted price due to capital structure; executives invest ~1 year's salary; returns taxed as capital gains

### Hurdle Rates and Ratchets

- Equity sits behind a hurdle rate: typically the PE firm must earn back full invested capital plus 8-12% annual return before management participates
- Management participates only in value above the threshold
- Ratchet mechanisms: If returns exceed aggressive targets (e.g., 25% IRR or 3x MOIC), management's share increases (e.g., from 10% to 15% of equity)
- ~62% of plans use both time and performance vesting; 50-67% of shares tied to performance vesting
- About two-thirds of investors use ratchets

## Co-Investment and Rollover

- Executives often required to invest personal capital ("skin in the game")
- Primary deals: investment up to 50% of base pay into equity
- Secondary deals: reinvest 30-49% of net proceeds
- Rollover appears in 57% of middle-market deals (2023), up from 46% (2020)
- Rolled equity sits junior to new debt and PE preferred equity — genuine downside risk
- About one-third of deals have mandatory rollover; 39% voluntary

## Vesting and Leaver Provisions

- Typical vesting: 4-5 years, or on exit
- 78% of plans require performance conditions (not just time)
- Performance metrics: MOIC, IRR, EBITDA targets
- Good/bad leaver provisions: departure before vesting = forfeiture of sweet equity
- Dismissed executives face forfeiture of unvested awards plus resale restrictions on vested shares
- These provisions create a strong "stay + perform" logic but heighten career risk

## Transaction Bonuses

- One-time payments of 50-200% of base salary
- Triggered by sale, IPO, or refinancing
- Sophisticated executives negotiate payment from the "transaction expense bucket" at the top of the capital waterfall — paid before equity distributions

## Tax Considerations

- Difference between income and capital gains treatment can dominate net outcomes
- Over 65% of management respondents rated tax as "very important" in structuring
- U.S. IRC Section 83(b) election: recognize income at transfer rather than at vesting for substantially nonvested property
- Profits interests: IRS safe harbors (Rev. Proc. 93-27, 2001-43) — receipt of qualifying profits interest for services generally not taxable
- Instrument selection negotiated alongside vesting, hurdles, and leaver rules because after-tax outcomes drive both retention and perceived fairness

## The 2-and-20 Pressure From Above

- PE firms charge investors: 2% annual management fee on committed capital + 20% of profits above a hurdle (typically 8%)
- For a $1B fund: ~$20M/year in fees + potentially $160-200M in carried interest
- The 20% carry only activates above the hurdle — creating intense pressure to grow portfolio company value, which flows directly to the CEO through their equity structure, KPI targets, and the call they get when monthly numbers disappoint
- The fund structure itself (10-year fund life, 20-25% annual return targets, carried interest incentives) creates relentless pressure that cascades from LPs to GPs to portfolio company executives

## Case Studies

### Petco: Equity Step-Up Under PE Ownership

During Petco's public phase (1995-1999), CEO Bruce Devine owned ~2% of equity. After the 2000 take-private, his ownership increased sharply to ~10%. When the company undertook an IPO in 2002, his share was reduced (~7%) and continued to fall. This illustrates how PE ownership concentrates executive equity — and how the CEO's internal valuation model shifts from annual bonus impact to expected influence on exit valuation and equity monetization.

### SolarWinds: Equity Plan Design and Reserved Capacity

SolarWinds' 2018 equity incentive plan (post-PE ownership) had 11.5M stock-based awards outstanding and 39.2M shares reserved for future grants. RSUs vested over four years; PSUs vested over three years based on performance targets. The plan included repurchase rights for restricted stock upon employee termination. This illustrates how PE sponsors design plan capacity to support retention, leadership changes, and extended holds without rewriting the entire compensation system.

### Toys R Us: When Leverage Destroys Value

Acquired in 2005 by KKR, Bain Capital, and Vornado for $6.6B with only $1.3B in equity. Annual interest payments of $400-500M consumed 97% of operating income in 2007 — preventing the store reinvestment and e-commerce upgrades needed to compete with Amazon. The company liquidated in 2018, with 33,000 workers receiving no severance while the PE firms collected $464M in fees and interest during ownership. This is the canonical example of how leverage can prevent the very investments needed for survival.
