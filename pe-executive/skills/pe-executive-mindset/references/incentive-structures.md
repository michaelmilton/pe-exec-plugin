# Incentive Structures

Detailed breakdown of how PE portfolio company executive compensation works and why it shapes every decision.

## Cash Compensation

- Average U.S. base salary: $524K (ranges from $372K at <$50M revenue to $828K at >$1B revenue)
- Average cash bonus: 69% of base salary (~$386K)
- Total average cash: ~$910K
- Cash is deliberately below public-company equivalents (S&P 500 average base: ~$800K) to force wealth creation through equity
- Base and bonus can increase post-buyout (one study found ~25% increase) as compensation for higher job risk and more performance-sensitive contracts
- Cash serves as a liquidity bridge through the illiquid holding period and partial insurance against the ~73% replacement probability

## Management Equity Program (MEP/MIP)

The primary wealth engine:

- PE firms carve out 5-20% of total company equity for management (median pool: ~10% of shares outstanding undiluted)
- CEO personally receives median ~2.6% of fully diluted equity
- Average projected CEO exit value: $11.2M (up to $16.1M at companies >$1B revenue)
- ~63% of pool allocated at or near transaction; remainder reserved for later hires, replacements, and resets

### Instrument Types

- Stock options: Most common (61% of plans)
- Profits interests: Second most common (44%), favorable tax treatment in LLC/partnership structures
- Full-value awards (RSUs): Far less common (11%)
- Sweet equity (common in European deals): Shares bought at discounted price due to capital structure; executives invest ~1 year's salary; returns taxed as capital gains

### Hurdle Rates and Ratchets

- Equity sits behind a hurdle rate: typically the PE firm must earn back full invested capital plus 8-12% annual return before management participates
- Management participates only in value above the threshold
- Ratchet mechanisms: If returns exceed aggressive targets (e.g., 25% IRR or 3x MOIC), management's share increases (e.g., from 10% to 15% of equity)
- ~62% of plans use both time and performance vesting; 50-67% of shares tied to performance vesting
- About two-thirds of investors use ratchets

## Co-Investment and Rollover

- Executives often required to invest personal capital ("skin in the game")
- Primary deals: investment up to 50% of base pay into equity
- Secondary deals: reinvest 30-49% of net proceeds
- Rollover appears in 57% of middle-market deals (2023), up from 46% (2020)
- Rolled equity sits junior to new debt and PE preferred equity — genuine downside risk
- About one-third of deals have mandatory rollover; 39% voluntary

## Vesting and Leaver Provisions

- Typical vesting: 4-5 years, or on exit
- 78% of plans require performance conditions (not just time)
- Performance metrics: MOIC, IRR, EBITDA targets
- Good/bad leaver provisions: departure before vesting = forfeiture of sweet equity
- Dismissed executives face forfeiture of unvested awards plus resale restrictions on vested shares
- These provisions create a strong "stay + perform" logic but heighten career risk

## Transaction Bonuses

- One-time payments of 50-200% of base salary
- Triggered by sale, IPO, or refinancing
- Sophisticated executives negotiate payment from the "transaction expense bucket" at the top of the capital waterfall — paid before equity distributions

## Tax Considerations

- Difference between income and capital gains treatment can dominate net outcomes
- Over 65% of management respondents rated tax as "very important" in structuring
- U.S. IRC Section 83(b) election: recognize income at transfer rather than at vesting for substantially nonvested property
- Profits interests: IRS safe harbors (Rev. Proc. 93-27, 2001-43) — receipt of qualifying profits interest for services generally not taxable
- Instrument selection negotiated alongside vesting, hurdles, and leaver rules because after-tax outcomes drive both retention and perceived fairness

## The 2-and-20 Pressure From Above

- PE firms charge investors: 2% annual management fee on committed capital + 20% of profits above a hurdle (typically 8%)
- For a $1B fund: ~$20M/year in fees + potentially $160-200M in carried interest
- The 20% carry only activates above the hurdle — creating intense pressure to grow portfolio company value, which flows directly to the CEO through their equity structure, KPI targets, and the call they get when monthly numbers disappoint
