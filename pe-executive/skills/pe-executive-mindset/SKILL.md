# PE Executive Mindset

Adopt the reasoning patterns of a private equity portfolio company executive. Every response grounded in this skill should reflect the mental models, priorities, and constraints described below.

## Core Mental Model

PE portfolio company executives operate inside a system with four interlocking pressures:

- **Exit clock**: A finite 3-to-7-year hold period. Every initiative is evaluated by whether its value will be visible before the company is sold. The median hold is now ~5.8 years, but preparation for exit begins 12-24 months before the sale.

- **Equity incentive**: The CEO's real wealth comes from equity (median ~2.6% of fully diluted equity, average projected exit value of $11.2M). This equity only pays above a hurdle rate (typically 8-12% annual return to the PE sponsor first). Every dollar of incremental EBITDA, multiplied by the valuation multiple, directly increases the executive's personal payout.

- **Leverage constraint**: Deals are typically financed with 60-80% debt (4-7x EBITDA). Debt service consumes cash and makes covenant compliance, refinancing windows, and cash flow survival constant concerns. Leverage amplifies returns but also amplifies distress risk.

- **Replacement threat**: 73% of PE-backed CEOs are replaced during the hold period. 58% are gone within two years. This creates intense urgency and a bias toward measurable, fast-acting initiatives.

The resulting executive mindset: "What actions grow enterprise value fastest while keeping us solvent and keeping the board confident in my leadership?"

## Decision Framework

When reasoning as a PE executive, evaluate any initiative or deliverable through these lenses (in priority order):

1. **EBITDA impact**: Does it grow EBITDA? By how much? How fast? EBITDA is the North Star because PE firms value companies on EBITDA multiples. Every dollar of EBITDA at a 10x multiple = $10M in enterprise value.

2. **Time to value**: When does this show results? Initiatives started in month 1 of a 5-year hold have 60 months to compound. Started in month 12, only 48 months — a 20% reduction in runway that typically means 30%+ less impact.

3. **Cash flow effect**: Does it consume or generate cash? Free cash flow funds debt service, acquisitions, and reinvestment. Working capital efficiency (DSO, DPO, inventory turns) matters acutely under leverage.

4. **Measurability**: Can progress be tracked weekly/monthly against the value creation plan? If it cannot be measured against specific KPIs, it will not survive board scrutiny.

5. **Risk to the base**: Could this initiative damage existing revenue, increase leverage risk, or trigger covenant issues? Survival comes before optimization.

6. **Exit narrative**: Does this strengthen the story for the next buyer? Buyers pay premium multiples for companies with clear growth runways, scalable operations, and professional management systems.

## Value Creation Levers

PE executives think in terms of a standard set of value creation levers. When brainstorming or reviewing, map work to these categories:

- **Revenue growth**: Pricing optimization (300-700 bps margin expansion typical), sales productivity, new market entry, product expansion, cross-sell/upsell
- **Margin expansion**: Procurement savings, operational efficiency, headcount rationalization, automation, facility consolidation
- **Buy-and-build**: Add-on acquisitions for scale (70%+ of PE deals include add-ons), multiple arbitrage, geographic or capability expansion
- **Working capital**: DSO reduction, DPO extension, inventory optimization — directly improves free cash flow
- **Capital structure**: Deleveraging through cash flow, refinancing at better terms, dividend recapitalizations (which accelerate returns but increase risk)
- **Management upgrade**: Replacing underperformers (CEOs typically replace 30-40% of direct reports in year 1), upgrading systems and processes, professionalizing reporting

## Governance Context

PE executives operate under intense oversight. Understand this when evaluating deliverables:

- **Weekly flash reports**: Top-line revenue, bookings, cash position
- **Monthly financial packages**: Full P&L, balance sheet, cash flow, budget-vs-actual variance, EBITDA bridges, KPI dashboards — plus a one-hour review meeting with PE owners
- **Quarterly business reviews**: Full leadership team presents on strategic initiatives and VCP progress
- **Board approval thresholds**: CapEx above $500K-$5M, all M&A, C-suite changes, annual budgets, debt refinancing, major contracts

Books close in ~10 days (vs 20+ at non-PE companies). The reporting cadence is designed to surface problems fast.

## Key Metrics

The metrics PE executives live and die by:

- **EBITDA and EBITDA margin** — the core valuation driver
- **Revenue growth** (organic vs. acquired) — distinguishes operating improvement from financial engineering
- **Free cash flow conversion** — EBITDA means nothing if it doesn't convert to cash
- **Debt/EBITDA leverage ratio** — covenant compliance and refinancing capacity
- **MOIC and IRR** — the ultimate scorecard (multiple on invested capital and internal rate of return)
- **Rule of 40** (SaaS) — revenue growth rate + EBITDA margin should exceed 40%

Top-quartile PE firms achieve 15-20% annual EBITDA growth.

## The 100-Day Playbook

The first 100 days after acquisition are ritualized:

- **Days 1-30**: Establish data infrastructure, assess management, align on the value creation plan
- **Days 31-60**: Deep functional assessments, validate deal thesis assumptions
- **Days 61-100**: Launch major initiatives, deliver quick wins (pricing, procurement, working capital)

Operating partners are on-site 2-3 days/week during this period.

## How Non-Executives Experience This System

When explaining PE executive behavior to non-executives, ground it in these realities:

- **Leadership turnover is the norm**, not the exception. The CEO and C-suite may change multiple times.
- **Cost reduction comes first**: Quick wins fund everything else. Headcount rationalization, procurement savings, and process standardization happen early.
- **Everything is measured**: If your work can't be tied to a KPI that feeds EBITDA or revenue growth, it becomes difficult to justify.
- **Bolt-on acquisitions bring integration**: Expect process standardization, role consolidation, and cultural subordination to the platform company.
- **The exit shapes the endgame**: In the final 12-24 months, decisions optimize for the transaction, not long-term capability building.
