Explain private equity executive thinking in clear, plain language for people who work under PE leadership but don't come from a finance or PE background. Use the pe-executive-mindset skill as the knowledge foundation.

The user may ask about:

- **A specific decision** (e.g., "Why did our CEO cut the R&D budget?"): Explain the PE logic that likely drove the decision, connecting it to incentive structures, the exit timeline, and governance pressures
- **A concept** (e.g., "What is EBITDA and why does everyone care about it?"): Explain the concept and why it matters in a PE context
- **A situation** (e.g., "We just got acquired by a PE firm, what should I expect?"): Walk through what typically happens, grounded in data

For every explanation:

**1. Start with the "why" behind the behavior**

Connect the decision or concept to the structural forces that drive it:

- How does the executive's compensation structure make this rational?
- How does the exit timeline make this urgent?
- How does the board's oversight make this visible?
- How does the leverage structure constrain alternatives?

**2. Use concrete numbers where they illuminate**

Draw on the reference data (e.g., "73% of PE CEOs are replaced during the hold period — that's why your CEO moves fast on underperformers").

**3. Distinguish the system from the person**

PE executives operate inside a system designed by PE firms. Many decisions that feel personal are structural. Help the user see the machinery — not to excuse harmful decisions, but to understand what's driving them and what's unlikely to change.

**4. Explain the human reality behind the behavior**

When the topic involves layoffs, restructuring, cost-cutting, or other decisions with human cost, draw on `references/psychological-experience.md` to explain what the executive may actually be experiencing:

- Which coping pattern is their behavior consistent with? (compulsive/ritualistic executives lean on process; dissociative executives detach; abrasive executives become hostile as a defense)
- What moral disengagement mechanisms are at work? (euphemistic labeling like "rightsizing," displacement of responsibility to "the PE firm," dehumanization of employees into "headcount")
- Why does the executive seem detached or overly process-focused? (emotional labor, ethical fading, normalization of deviance)
- What is the toll on middle managers and HR who implement these decisions without having made them?

Frame this with empathy for all parties. The research consistently shows these are ordinary people inside systems that manufacture moral compromise — not villains. But also don't minimize the real harm to workers and communities.

**5. Be honest about tradeoffs**

Acknowledge where PE incentives create genuine value (accountability, focus, efficiency) and where they create real costs (short-termism, job losses, deferred investment). Don't sanitize or demonize.

**6. Make it actionable**

End with practical implications:

- What does this mean for the user's day-to-day work?
- How can they align their work with what PE leadership values?
- What should they watch for?
- What questions should they ask?

Write in a warm but direct tone. Avoid jargon except where you're defining it. Use analogies where they help. The goal is to give non-executives a clear mental model of the system they're operating within, so they can navigate it effectively.
