# The moral weight of the axe: what research reveals about executives who must cut

The scholarly and experiential literature converges on a single, uncomfortable truth: **executives who conduct layoffs and restructurings — particularly at private equity-backed companies — suffer genuine psychological harm**, yet the same institutional systems that wound them also provide sophisticated mechanisms for numbing that pain. This duality sits at the heart of one of organizational psychology’s most compelling tensions. Far from a gap in the research, the executive experience of “making the hard calls” has been studied through at least seven distinct academic lenses — moral injury, moral disengagement, dirty work theory, cognitive dissonance, emotional labor, sensemaking, and clinical psychodynamics — plus a growing body of first-person accounts and structural critiques. What emerges is not a simple story of villains or victims, but a portrait of how organizational systems recruit ordinary, often well-meaning people into causing harm, then equip them with just enough psychological armor to keep going.

## The clinical reality: five ways executioners cope

The foundational research on executives who implement layoffs comes from **Manfred Kets de Vries and Katharina Balazs at INSEAD**, whose landmark 1997 study in *Human Relations* — “The Downside of Downsizing” — introduced the term **“executioners”** for those responsible for implementing workforce reductions. Using clinical psychodynamic interviews, they identified five distinct coping patterns among executioners: 

**Compulsive/ritualistic** executives treat layoffs as mechanical duty, leaning heavily on process and procedure to avoid emotional engagement. **Abrasive** executives become hostile and aggressive as a defense mechanism. **Dissociative** executives emotionally detach entirely from the situation. **Alexithymic** executives lose the ability to identify or express their emotions — a clinical numbness. And **depressive** executives experience guilt, sorrow, sleeplessness, and clinical depression symptoms.   One interviewee captured the experience plainly: *“It’s a very uncomfortable feeling. Anyone who tells you that they don’t mind laying people off — in my humble opinion, I think is crazy.”* 

This clinical taxonomy has held up across subsequent research.   A 2024 qualitative study published via Taylor & Francis — “How Managers Experience Downsizing” — interviewed 21 managers at a Finnish manufacturing company and found they adopted **four discursive positions**: Professional (rationalistic, duty-focused), Loyal (aligned with employer), Empathic (guilt-expressing, compassion-driven), and Critical (directed at top management).  Crucially, managers occupied no permanent position but shifted constantly among them,  suggesting the experience is not stable but **chronically oscillating** between rationalization and distress.

The “necessary evils” research program led by **Joshua Margolis (Harvard) and Andrew Molinsky (Brandeis)** adds further nuance. Their 2008 study in the *Academy of Management Journal*, drawing on 111 qualitative interviews with managers, doctors, and police officers, found that performers of necessary evils experience a characteristic “emotional cocktail”  — **sympathy, sadness, guilt, shame, anxiety, and sometimes anger** — and that the core challenge is doing “two seemingly contradictory things at once: be compassionate and be direct.”  Their research specifically documented how companies often structure layoff processes to minimize emotional expression, telling managers to “keep discussions to the minimum” — a practice that protects the organization but deepens the executor’s moral isolation.

## Seven theoretical lenses on the same wound

The academic literature offers remarkable convergence from multiple theoretical traditions, each illuminating a different dimension of the executive experience.

**Moral injury**, originally defined by psychiatrist Jonathan Shay in his study of Vietnam veterans (*Achilles in Vietnam*, 1994), has been explicitly applied to corporate contexts. Ron Carucci and Ludmila Praslova, writing in *Harvard Business Review* (2022), defined workplace moral injury as “a trauma response to witnessing or participating in workplace behaviors that contradict one’s moral beliefs in high-stakes situations.”  Their critical insight: **moral injury is not burnout**. It is an ethical wound that affects identity, trust, and meaning — and it strikes hardest in people who care deeply about their work, not those who are indifferent.

**Albert Bandura’s moral disengagement theory** explains how executives psychologically survive these wounds. His eight mechanisms — moral justification, euphemistic labeling  (“rightsizing” instead of “mass firing”), advantageous comparison, displacement of responsibility (“the PE firm set the targets”), diffusion of responsibility, distortion of consequences, dehumanization (employees become “headcount” or “FTEs”), and attribution of blame  — operate pervasively in corporate restructuring. Bandura’s 2016 book *Moral Disengagement: How People Do Harm and Live with Themselves*  includes a dedicated chapter on the corporate world. Celia Moore’s work  at London Business School  extends this framework to organizational corruption,   finding that **executives who morally disengage more readily may be systematically rewarded and promoted**  — a self-reinforcing selection effect with direct implications for PE portfolio management.

**Dirty work theory**, developed by Blake Ashforth and Glen Kreiner at Arizona State (*Academy of Management Review*, 1999), examines how workers in stigmatized occupations construct positive identities despite the “taint” of their roles. Conducting layoffs constitutes morally stigmatized dirty work, and executives employ characteristic defenses: reframing (casting layoffs as “necessary business decisions”), recalibrating moral standards, refocusing on positive aspects of their role, and selectively comparing themselves favorably to more callous competitors. A 2014 extension found that **moral dirty work constitutes a graver identity threat** than physical or social dirty work, driving stronger reliance on in-group members as social buffers. 

The remaining lenses — **cognitive dissonance** (the identity-action gap between “I develop people” and “I am terminating them”), **emotional labor** (Hochschild’s framework applied to CEOs who must project confidence while experiencing guilt), **sensemaking** (Weick’s and Balogun’s work on how managers construct meaning from morally ambiguous restructurings),  and **ethical fading** (Tenbrunsel and Bazerman’s research on how organizational language and incentive structures systematically remove ethical dimensions from decisions)  — all point toward the same conclusion. The executive experience of conducting layoffs is not a single phenomenon but a **compound psychological event** involving simultaneous ethical wounding, identity threat, emotional suppression, and cognitive restructuring.

## First-person accounts reveal the 3 a.m. reality

The most viscerally honest executive account remains Ben Horowitz’s ***The Hard Thing About Hard Things*** (2014), which describes lying awake at 3 a.m. during the dot-com collapse while running Loudcloud/Opsware, making layoffs that cut friends and colleagues.  His often-quoted line — *“The hard thing isn’t setting a big, hairy, audacious goal. The hard thing is laying people off when you miss the big goal”*  — captures the gulf between strategic ambition and human consequence. Horowitz’s account of “The Struggle” — the psychological freefall of walking into the office pretending to be calm when you are not  — directly illustrates Hochschild’s emotional labor theory applied to CEO life.

Brian Chesky’s May 2020 letter laying off 1,900 Airbnb employees (25% of the workforce)  became the gold standard of executive communication during layoffs  and, simultaneously, a revealing psychological document. Chesky later admitted on Adam Grant’s *ReThinking* podcast that he wrote the letter quickly, “wrote what I felt,” and was “pretty emotional.”   His use of the word “love” — later regretted — exposed the genuine confusion executives face between institutional obligation and personal attachment.   His subsequent reflection that *“you don’t fire members of your family”* reveals the cognitive dissonance at work. 

For the PE-specific perspective, **Kenneth Freeman’s 2016 HBR essay** stands alone. As both chairman of Quest Diagnostics and a partner at KKR, Freeman wrote: *“In my more than 40 years in industry, much of it in turnaround situations, I have become convinced that the tough guy approach makes no sense.”*  His advocacy for a “soft hands” approach — treating employees with consideration during closures — emerged directly from his experience operating at the intersection of PE ownership and corporate leadership.  **Adam Coffey’s *The Private Equity Playbook*** (2019), written from the perspective of a CEO who ran three PE-backed companies, provides the portfolio company leader’s lived experience of PE dynamics, though with less emotional candor. Carrie Sun’s ***Private Equity: A Memoir*** (2024) — named TIME’s Must-Read Book of 2024 — offers a literary examination of what PE culture does to individuals   from the vantage point of a personal assistant inside what is widely identified as Tiger Global Management. 

The investigative literature adds crucial counterpoint. Brendan Ballou’s ***Plunder: Private Equity’s Plan to Pillage America*** (2023) and Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner’s ***These Are the Plunderers*** (2023)  document the human cost of PE from the worker and community perspective. A striking research finding from the NBER — Gupta et al. in *The Review of Financial Studies* (2024) — found that **PE ownership of nursing homes increased Medicare patient mortality by 11%**, with an estimated 20,150 additional deaths over 12 years. This quantification of human harm provides the stakes against which executive psychological distress must be weighed.

## How systems manufacture moral compromise

The most intellectually rigorous literature on the executive’s moral position comes not from psychology but from sociology and organizational theory, and it converges on a structural rather than personal explanation.

**Robert Jackall’s *Moral Mazes*** (1988) — based on years of ethnographic fieldwork interviewing managers across multiple corporations  — established the foundational insight: *“What is right in the corporation is what the guy above you wants from you. That’s what morality is in the corporation.”*  Jackall describes “a finely honed odyssey of moral transformation, in which the actors themselves remain largely unaware of the nature of their journey.”  This is extraordinarily relevant to PE portfolio company CEOs, whose morality is defined by what the PE fund demands, whose business plans are “written in blood,”  and whose equity incentives align their interests with the fund’s exit thesis.

**Diane Vaughan’s *The Challenger Launch Decision*** (1996) introduced “normalization of deviance” — the gradual process by which unacceptable practices become acceptable through repetition without immediate catastrophe.   Vaughan’s central argument explicitly **repudiates villain narratives**, insisting that NASA managers were not amoral calculators but conformists whose organizational culture gradually redefined dangerous deviations as normal.  Applied to PE, the framework explains how each round of cost-cutting that doesn’t produce immediate disaster becomes the new baseline, enabling progressively deeper cuts. The first 5% headcount reduction seems reasonable; then 10%; then facility closure. Each step is small. The cumulative effect is devastating.

Hannah Arendt’s concept of the **“banality of evil”** from *Eichmann in Jerusalem* (1963) — the idea that harm can be perpetrated by ordinary bureaucrats through “thoughtlessness” rather than malice  — has been applied to corporate contexts by scholars including Jacob Dahl Rendtorff  (Springer, 2014) and John Darley in his essay “Social Organization for the Production of Evil” (*Psychological Inquiry*, 1992). Zygmunt Bauman’s *Modernity and the Holocaust* (1989)  extended this analysis  to identify three mechanisms of bureaucratic harm — authority, routinization, and dehumanization  — that map precisely onto PE operations: **the PE board directs, the CEO executes; quarterly targets routinize decisions; employees become “headcount.”** Bauman’s most relevant insight: “Cruelty correlates with certain patterns of social interaction much more closely than it does with personality features.” 

Ann Tenbrunsel and Max Bazerman’s concept of **“ethical fading”** — developed in *Social Justice Research* (2004)   and expanded in *Blind Spots* (Princeton, 2011)  — explains the mechanism by which ethical dimensions disappear from executive decision frames. Four enablers drive self-deception: language euphemisms  (“optimizing the cost structure”), the slippery slope of incremental decisions, errors in perceptual causation, and constraints from self-image. PE contexts are saturated with these enablers. Guido Palazzo, Franciska Krings, and Ulrich Hoffrage extended this in *Journal of Business Ethics* (2012) with the concept of **“ethical blindness”**  — a temporary, unconscious state where ethical dimensions are “seemingly non-existent for the duration.”   Their identified triggers — ambitiously stretched goals, narrow and highly incentivized structures, ambiguous rules  — read like a description of PE portfolio management.

The structural critique reaches its most comprehensive form in **Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt’s *Private Equity at Work*** (Russell Sage Foundation, 2014), the definitive academic examination of PE’s impact on workers and companies. They document how  the fund structure itself — **10-year fund life,  20-25% annual return targets,  carried interest incentives** — creates relentless pressure that cascades to portfolio company CEOs. Guy Adams and Danny Balfour’s concept of **“administrative evil”** (*Unmasking Administrative Evil*, 1998) provides the capstone framework: “The common characteristic of administrative evil is that ordinary people within their normal professional and administrative roles can engage in acts of evil without being aware that they are doing anything wrong.”

## The forgotten middle: managers and HR professionals who carry the weight

The research on middle managers and HR professionals reveals a population under even greater strain than senior executives, because they bear the emotional burden of implementation without the psychological compensation of having made the decision.

Wright and Barling’s “The Executioners’ Song” (*Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences*, 1998) was among the first studies to focus on the subjective experience of managers tasked with delivering layoff news. Joel Brockner’s extensive research program at Columbia Business School — spanning from 1986 through the 2000s across *Administrative Science Quarterly*, *California Management Review*, and multiple edited volumes — established the organizational justice framework for understanding survivor reactions,   including a specific study on how **managers’ self-esteem is damaged by layoffs they administer** and how this shapes their subsequent behavior (Wiesenfeld, Brockner & Thibault, 2000, *Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes*). 

David Noer’s ***Healing the Wounds*** (1993, revised 2009) coined the term **“layoff survivor sickness”**   and drew explicit parallels between organizational survivor trauma and clinical trauma psychology.  His four-level intervention model — managing the process, facilitating grieving, breaking codependency, and building a new employment relationship — remains the standard practitioner framework.  Peter Frost and Sandra Robinson’s concept of **“toxic handlers”** (1999) identifies managers who absorb the organizational grief and anger associated with layoffs, often at severe personal cost.

The data on HR professionals is particularly stark. A **2025 Mind Share Partners report** found that HR professionals report higher burnout (**54% vs. 48%** for non-HR employees), higher depression (**54% vs. 44%**), and higher anxiety (**51% vs. 42%**). Most strikingly, **46% of HR professionals reported witnessing things at work that go against their values** — compared to 29% of non-HR employees — and 46% admitted doing things misaligned with their own morals (vs. 18% non-HR).  This is moral injury by any clinical definition. A Workvivo survey found **98% of HR professionals** reported burnout in the prior six months.  The very personality characteristics that make HR professionals successful — empathy, attentiveness to others’ needs — are precisely what predispose them to compassion fatigue and burnout. 

Middle managers face an additional structural burden: they are increasingly being laid off themselves. Bloomberg data shows **middle managers comprised 30% of all layoffs in 2023**, up from 20% in 2018.  Manager ranks dropped 6.1% between May 2022 and May 2025.  The people tasked with delivering layoff news are simultaneously among the most likely to receive it.

## Practical resources for those living this experience

For executives and managers currently navigating these decisions, several evidence-based resources stand out. **Rasmus Hougaard and Jacqueline Carter’s *Compassionate Leadership*** (Harvard Business Review Press, 2022), based on data from thousands of leaders across nearly 100 countries, directly addresses how to balance compassion with the wisdom required for hard decisions, introducing the “Wise Compassion Flywheel” framework.  **Wayne Cascio’s *Responsible Restructuring*** (2002) provides the empirical case — based on 18 years of S&P 500 data — that companies restructuring through downsizing are often **not more profitable** than those that don’t,   giving executives genuine alternatives to default cost-cutting. 

The Margolis and Molinsky research program offers specific practical guidance: have pairs or teams perform layoff tasks together rather than alone; create ample time and space afterward for decompression and debriefing; provide private environments; and recognize that organizations should focus on the well-being of those who *perform* layoffs, not only those who receive them.  The emerging field of executive therapy — practiced by specialists like Dr. Benjamin Rosen (CEREVITY) and Dr. Annia Raja — reports that **55% of CEOs experienced mental health challenges in 2024**, a 24-point jump from prior years,  and that nearly half report loneliness that intensifies these challenges. 

Several podcast episodes offer candid executive-level discussion: Matt Mochary on Lenny’s Podcast discussing how to handle firings with grace;  Brian Chesky’s reflection on Adam Grant’s *ReThinking* podcast; Chip Conley on the *Call In* podcast sharing experiences from Joie de Vivre and mentoring at Airbnb;  and Kim Scott on the *Radical Candor* podcast sharing layoff stories from both sides.  The documentary *OpenGate SHUTDOWN*, produced by Americans for Financial Reform, captures the community impact of PE-driven restructuring through the lens of workers in Janesville, Wisconsin.

## Conclusion: the system is the subject

The most important insight across this entire body of research is not about individual psychology but about institutional design. Every major scholar in this tradition — Vaughan, Jackall, Arendt, Bauman, Bandura, Tenbrunsel, Appelbaum and Batt — maintains explicit empathy for individuals within harmful systems. Vaughan repudiates villain narratives.   Jackall describes actors “unaware of the nature of their journey.”  Bandura studies how “otherwise considerate people” are recruited into harmful behavior. Tenbrunsel and Bazerman’s entire framework assumes people *want* to be ethical but are systematically undermined.  

The critical gap in the literature remains PE-specific: **no empirical study has directly examined moral injury in PE portfolio company executives**, and the intersection of financial incentivization (carried interest, equity stakes) and moral processing remains unstudied. The experience of serial “executioners” — operating partners and portfolio company CEOs who conduct multiple restructurings across different companies — is essentially unresearched. What exists is a rich theoretical architecture and a handful of candid first-person accounts, enough to understand the phenomenon in outline but not yet in the granular, ethnographic detail it deserves. The person who writes the *Moral Mazes* of private equity — conducting deep qualitative fieldwork inside portfolio companies during restructuring — will produce one of the most important business books of the coming decade.
