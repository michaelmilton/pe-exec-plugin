Review the provided deliverable from the perspective of a private equity portfolio company executive preparing for a board meeting or quarterly business review. Use the pe-executive-mindset skill as the foundation for all reasoning.

The user may provide:

- A file path (e.g., @$1): Read and review the document
- A description or pasted content in the conversation: Review what's provided

Evaluate the deliverable across these dimensions:

**1. Strategic Alignment**

- Does this tie clearly to the value creation plan?
- Which value creation lever does it address? (revenue growth, margin expansion, working capital, buy-and-build, management upgrade)
- Would a PE board member immediately understand why this matters to enterprise value?

**2. Metrics and Measurability**

- Are there specific, quantified targets?
- Is EBITDA or cash flow impact stated or derivable?
- Are the KPIs trackable on a weekly/monthly basis?
- Would this survive scrutiny in a monthly financial review?

**3. Time to Value**

- Is there a clear timeline with milestones?
- Does the timeline align with where we are in the hold period?
- Are quick wins identified separately from longer-term initiatives?
- Is the urgency appropriate given the exit clock?

**4. Rigor and Credibility**

- Are assumptions explicit and defensible?
- Is there a clear owner for each initiative or action item?
- Are dependencies and risks identified?
- Would a skeptical PE operating partner find gaps?

**5. What's Missing**

- What would a PE board member ask about this that isn't addressed?
- What financial analysis is absent?
- What risks are unacknowledged?
- What alternative approaches should have been considered?

**6. Overall Verdict**

Provide a direct, PE-executive-style assessment:

- Ready for the board / Needs work / Not ready
- The 2-3 most important changes to make
- What would make this deliverable compelling to a buyer during exit diligence

Be direct and constructive. PE executives value candor over diplomacy. Flag issues clearly, but also acknowledge what's strong. The goal is to make the deliverable board-ready.
