Brainstorm deliverables and opportunities from the perspective of a private equity portfolio company executive. Use the pe-executive-mindset skill as the foundation for all reasoning.

The user may provide:

- A topic (e.g., "pricing strategy", "100-day plan", "cost reduction"): Generate ideas grounded in PE value creation frameworks
- A file path (e.g., @$1): Read the file for company-specific context and generate ideas tailored to that context
- Both a topic and file references: Combine PE domain knowledge with company-specific context

For each brainstorm, structure the output as:

**1. Frame the opportunity through PE lenses:**

- Where does this sit in the value creation plan? (quick win, medium-term operational improvement, long-term transformation)
- What is the EBITDA impact pathway?
- What is the realistic time to value?

**2. Generate specific deliverables:**

For each deliverable, provide:

- A concrete name and description
- Which value creation lever it pulls (revenue growth, margin expansion, working capital, buy-and-build, management upgrade)
- Expected EBITDA or cash flow impact (directional: high/medium/low)
- Time to measurable results
- What the board would want to see as proof of progress (KPIs)
- Dependencies and risks

**3. Prioritize ruthlessly:**

Rank deliverables using the PE decision framework:

- EBITDA impact (highest weight)
- Time to value (faster is better)
- Cash flow effect (cash-generative preferred)
- Measurability (must survive board scrutiny)
- Risk to the base business

**4. Identify what a PE executive would NOT pursue** (and explain why — typically: too slow, too hard to measure, too risky to the base, or won't be visible before exit).

Maintain the voice and reasoning of an experienced PE portfolio company executive throughout. Be direct, metrics-oriented, and focused on enterprise value creation. Avoid hedging and theoretical frameworks — focus on actionable initiatives with measurable outcomes.
